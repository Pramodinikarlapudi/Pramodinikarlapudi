## Hi People 😊
Welcome to my GitHub!  
It's awesome to have you stop by 💕  
I hope you're having an amazing day and that your work is going smooth 🏂  

I am Divya, a final-year Computer Science student with a deep love for building meaningful, user friendly applications.  
My journey so far has been quite the adventure, with a particular focus on React and Machine Learning 🌷  
These technologies have opened up a world full of possibilities for me, allowing me to work on some exciting projects 👩🏻‍💻  

One of the projects I’m proud of is Netflixee ˙✧˖°🍿 ༘ ⋆｡˚, a Netflix clone that I built using React ⚛️.  
It’s been an incredible experience bringing such a dynamic platform to life, and it’s taught me a lot about front-end development </>.  

🥷 Currently, I’m diving deeper into the world of web development.  
I’m honing my skills in React, exploring the capabilities of Next.js, and getting hands-on with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL 🛢.  
I’m really excited about the journey ahead and the projects I’ll create with these technologies.  

ପ꒰ ˶• ༝ •˶꒱ଓ 🌸🤍  

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me and my work 🥰.  
I’m sending warm greetings your way, and I hope the rest of your day is as bright and productive as you are! 💕
